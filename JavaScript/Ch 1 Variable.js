// Variable Declaration:
// To declare a variable in JavaScript:
// Before ES6 -> var was used -> After ES6 -> let is used
// const is used to define constant -> throughout the program value not changed

// Let, Const -> Used To Block Scope Variable Declaration 
// Var -> Globally Scoped
// Let Can Be Updated But Not Re-declared
// Const -> Neither Updated Nor Re-declared
// Var -> Can Be Updated And Re-declared 
// Var & Let Is Initialized With Undefined ->  Const Are Not 
var dp;
let ap;
const hp; //Error

var myVariable;     // Declaration using var
let anotherVariable;  // Declaration using let
const PI = 3.14159;   // Declaration using const

// JS is Case Sensitive 

// You can also declare and assign a value to a variable in a single line.

//JavaScript Data-Type
//Object Is Non Primitive Data-Type
// Primitive -> Null, Number, String, Symbol, Undefined, Boolean, Bigint -> Fundamental Data-Type -> nn bb ss u


let y = BigInt("265");
let x = Symbol("I Am Symbol");
let s = null; //Define Null

// Type
console.log(typeof x);

//Object -> In Python -> Dictionary 
//ES6 -> ECMAScript -> Modern JavaScript
const item = {
  name: "CryptoMinds",
  age: "12"
  //Key: Value
}

console.log(item["age"]); //Look Up

//Scope -> Alt + Click -> Multiple Cursor In Replit
//var

var b = 11;
var b = 13; // Allow To Use

{
  var b = 15;
  console.log(b);
}
console.log(b);

//Output
// 15
// 15

//let

let b = 11;

{
  let b = 15;
  console.log(b);
}
console.log(b);

//Output
// 15
// 11


let c = 16;
c = 17; //Update


let d = 16;
let d = 17; //Error






var myNumber = 42;
let myString = "JavaScript";
const myConstant = true;

// Variable Naming:
// JavaScript variable names can include letters, digits, 
// underscores, and dollar signs. They must start with a letter, 
// underscore, or dollar sign (but not a digit). JavaScript is 
// case-sensitive, so myVariable and myvariable are considered 
// different variables.

var firstName;
let age;
const PI = 3.14;



// Better Practice to use let and Const
// Mostly Use Const
// JS Allow to Change Variable Type In Run Time -> Only One


function myFunction() {
  var x = 10;       // Function-scoped variable
  if (x > 5) {
    let y = 20;    // Block-scoped variable
    console.log(x + y);
  }
  console.log(x);  // Accessible
  console.log(y);  // Error: y is not defined
}


// Variable Hoisting:
// JavaScript has a concept called "hoisting," where variable and function 
// declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase. 
// Variables declared with var are hoisted but are not initialized until the line where 
// they are defined. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.


console.log(x);   // Undefined
var x = 10;


// Variable Constants:
// Variables declared with const are constants, meaning their value cannot be reassigned 
// once it is set. 
// However, it's important to note that const does not make objects or arrays immutable. 
// It only prevents the reassignment of the variable itself.


const PI = 3.14;
PI = 3.14159;   // Error: Assignment To Constant Variable

const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.push(4);    // Valid, Since The Array Itself Is Mutable

// Conclusion:
// JavaScript variables play a crucial role in storing and manipulating data within a program. 
// By understanding variable declaration, assignment, naming, scope, and the differences 
// between var, let, and const, developers can effectively work with variables 
// to create dynamic and interactive JavaScript applications.
